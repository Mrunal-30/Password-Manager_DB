# Password-Manager_DB
PassOp is a simple and lightweight password manager built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. Unlike its earlier version that used localStorage, this updated version now stores passwords securely in a MongoDB database through a backend API. It allows users to add, view, and delete password entries by entering the site name, username, and password. Users can also copy passwords to the clipboard with a single click. The interface is clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly, offering a smooth user experience powered by React’s state management using useState and useEffect.

The project follows a modular structure with core logic handled in components like Manager.jsx. All data is sent to a backend built with Node.js and Express.js, where it is stored in MongoDB using Mongoose. The application uses Vite for fast development, and the frontend can be accessed via http://localhost:5173/ after setup. While this version offers better persistence by using MongoDB, it does not yet include encryption or user authentication, so it’s still intended as a learning tool and not recommended for storing sensitive data in production. The footer component has been removed for a cleaner interface.
